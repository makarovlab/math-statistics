#### Chapter 3: Processing pipelines

Welcome back! This chapter is dedicated to processing pipelines: a series of functions applied to a doc to add attributes like part-of-speech tags, dependency labels or named entities.

In this lesson, you'll learn about the pipeline components provided by spaCy, and what happens behind the scenes when you call nlp on a string of text.
